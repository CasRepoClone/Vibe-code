-- How to use this application --

urban exploration LOCATION WEBSCRAPER - POLAND 
- this application scrapes entries off a site and gets the location data rather than manually searching for locations 
- keywords in polish such as 'abandoned' 'fort' 'bunker' can be used to find places of historical importance that are relatively unknown

1) enter your Api key to .env
2) run the program savePages.py to collect a hell of a lot of data 
3) leave scraper2.py running 
4) run duplicateRemoval.py until finished 
5) run the app.py and start /templates/map.html to see your pins
